**[Binary Tree]{.ul}**

A hierarchical tree where each element has at most 2 child elements and
one parent element

-   Topmost element is referred to as the root

-   Elements directly under an element are referred to as that element's
    children

-   The element directly above an element is referred to as that
    element's parent

Each element consists of at least:

-   Data

-   Pointer to the left child

-   Pointer to the right child

[Why Trees?]{.ul}

-   Easily store data that naturally forms a hierarchy

    -   Examples

        -   File system

-   Provides decent performance on access and search, quicker than
    linked lists but slower than arrays

-   Provides decent performance on deletion, quicker than arrays but
    slower than unordered linked lists

-   No limit on size or number of elements outside of memory

**Applications**

-   Manipulate hierarchical data

-   Make data easier to search

-   Manipulate sorted lists of data
