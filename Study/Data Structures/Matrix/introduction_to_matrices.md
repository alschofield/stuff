**[Matrices]{.ul}**

A matrix represents a collection of nine numbers arranged in three rows
and three columns, should be represented enclosed in brackets

Not much good documentation where im looking

But could be represented with an array with 9 elements, after every
three elements would represent a row, would be able to create some sort
of set of operations for that
