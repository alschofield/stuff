this refresher stuff, dont plan on going too much more into this stuff for right now, although i do need to go more in to a couple of these at some point (in particular BST and Graph, and would like to create examples in a couple languages), above source has a lot more stuff but worth looking for more sources as well

also want to back fill some of the others with more info and examples in the future but is lower priority for me right now, some of these are not used as often as others and are used more in certain case in others and i dont need to deal with those cases right now, some are quite simple and dont have too much too it, but would like to have basic implimentations of them in different languages
