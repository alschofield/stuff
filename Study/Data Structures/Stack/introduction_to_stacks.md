**[Stacks]{.ul}**

A stack is a linear data structure (uses an Array or Linked List) that
follows particular rules on how to handle operations (LIFO/FILO last in
first out/first in last out)

Real life example would be stacked plates, first plate placed in the
stack will be the last plate removed from the stack, last plate placed
on the stack will be the first plate removed, any plates placed on the
stack will be removed before any plates that were there before

[Three Basic Operations]{.ul}

-   Push

    -   Add an item to the top of the stack, if the stack is full then
        it is in overflow condition often referred to stack overflow

-   Pop

    -   Remove an item from the top of the stack

    -   If the stack is empty, it is stack underflow

-   Peek or Top

    -   Returns the element on the top of the stack

-   IsEmpty

    -   Returns Boolean representing whether there are elements in the
        stack or not

**All operations should be O(1) unless circumstances require otherwise**

Examples include:

-   In memory management

-   Page state in browsers

-   Change history in editors
