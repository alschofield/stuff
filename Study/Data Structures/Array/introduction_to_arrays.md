-   First element is 0, increments linearly for each element \[0, 1, 2,
    > 3, ..., n\]

> **1 Base:**

    > \[1, 2, 3, 4, ..., n\]

> **N Base:**

-   the base index can be set

-   need to look more into this in another session

[Advantages]{.ul}

-   random access to elements

-   good cache locality
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference>

-   represents multiple elements with a single name

[Disadvantages]{.ul}

-   can't change size (javascript arrays?)

[Applications]{.ul}

-   stores data elements

-   used for cpu scheduling
