- again, i am far from an expert in this and these are some initial findings and thoughts ive accrued on the matter, im fully aware a lot more time could and will be spent here
- this has been a hard one, trying to go as broad as i can but i dont have as much knowledge of racial inequality outside of american history and im trying not to get to gruesome or negative, i fully intend to revisit this topic more because theres a lot
- i know this is a sensitive topic, there are way better people to cover this than me and you should refer to them over me, please dont hate me
- this isnt supposed to be a comprehensive document to understand all of racial inequality and more a jumping off point for more research or conversation to be had
- some of these things may be conjecture and id implore anyone to correct where they see fit
