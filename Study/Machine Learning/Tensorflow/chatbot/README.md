example of a basic chatbot from tensorflow

a little out of date
also slow af to train
need to go over this and figure what exactly is going on through all of it
maybe look for more up to date examples
want to find pros and cons of this vs amazon/microsoft/google ai services
- sagemaker looks pretty sick
- been having trouble making a azure account so havent been abble to get to their stuff
- google would be after sagemaker and anything else amazon has rn

tensorflow/not a saas
pros
- seems like main benefits would be customizaility
- like maybe i have more control over loss functions annd the specifics of training and tests that are run
- would presumaley be able to implement new advances in algos or other areas more quickly and easily

cons
- may be out of my league to support myself
- may not have good amount of time to invest into deep diving into this stuff
- just me
- not as many guides and standards to follow

saas ai
pros
- most likely quick annd easy
- technnical support
- team of people making advances for me
- guides and standards

cons
- less customizability
- cant support the internals myself or with someone i have good/easy access to
- money
