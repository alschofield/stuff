notes

plan to put all the stuff i am studying here, eventually i want to consolidate all my knowledge of this kind of stuff here in text format so i can always easily access it and maybe it could be helpful to someone someday

starting with refreshing and solidifying some knowledge then moving to new stuff
will backfill more intensly in the future

trying to site sources that i am using while im actually doing these things, but obviously i have prior knowledge and i work with some of these things on a daily basis and i cant/dont want to translate some if not most of that stuff here

some of these files may not be my own, i plan on putting templates and things in here, so that could include code from outside sources, this isnt supposed to be a representation of my work

also, in the case that someone stumbles upon this, this is supplemental at best to any learning anyone is already doing, this is by no means thorough enough to cover everything someone would need to know or do to accomplish most of the things referenced in a professional or production environment, and i dont ever intend it to be, this is intended to ultimately be some sort of like quick sheet esqe dev encyclopedia, help is welcome please reach out if you would like to do so in some way

oh also a lot of these files are word docs, ill work on creating at least md files
