backseat to some of the framework stuff currently

there are actually quite a few languages i want to dip my hands in so expect things here eventually

also quite a few i can backfill but that might take even longer

always good to know more languages, more helpful to coworkers and more money from companies

current order
- java
- swift
- kotlin
