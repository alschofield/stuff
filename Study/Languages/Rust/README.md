# to know
- rustc will compile file into executable
- cargo
  - cargo new [project_name]
    - create new project
  - cargo run
    - if not compiled/built, compile and then run executable
  - cargo build
    - build/compile project into executable
  - cargo check
    - check if build will succeed
- .toml is package manager
  - lock file as well
- constants
  - dont change
  - uppercase with underscores
  - cant be mut
  - must be type annotated
- shadowing
  - using let, allows you to reuse variables to reset those variables and have them be immutable afterwards
  - must use let when changing variable
  - different from mutable because it is only ever mutable when (re)assigning let and it allows for type mutation as well
- data types
  - scalar
    - integer
      - unsigned vs signed
        - unsigned is always positive (doesnt need a sign)
        - signed can be negative or positive (needs a sign (+/-))
      - integer types
        - 8-bit	i8	u8
        - 16-bit	i16	u16
        - 32-bit	i32	u32
        - 64-bit	i64	u64
        - 128-bit	i128	u128
        - arch	isize	usize (64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you’re on a 32-bit architecture)
      - character type (strings)
        - char
    - floating point (floats)
      - numbers with decimals
      - types
        - f32
        - f64
    - booleans
      - true or false
      - type
        - bool
    - characters
      - strings
      - type
        - char
  - compound
    - tuples
      - grouping of other types
      - fixed in length
      - type
        - (i8, bool, f32)
      - accessing
        - tuple.index
    - arrays
      - grouping of the same type
      - type
        - [i32; 5]
      - accessing
        - array[index]
- function
  - snake case (lowercase underscores)
  - annotated type parameters
- comments
  - //
- if/else
  - if bool { expression } else if bool { expression } else { expression }
- loops
  - loop { expression }
  - while bool { expression }
  - for variable in array { expression }
- keywords
  - use - imports dependency
  - let - defines variable
  - const - defines const
  - fn - defines function
  - mut - sets variable mutability
- ownership
  - each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its owner.
  - there can only be one owner at a time.
  - when the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
  - stack and heap
    - see data structures directory
    - stack
      - first in, first out
      - must have fixed size
    - heap
      - request space
      - returns pointer
      - slower than stack
  - scope same as other languages
  - https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#the-string-type
  - clone
  - references
    - syntax &name/type
    - mutable references
      - &mut
      - can only have one in the same scope
      - can only have mutable or immutable in memory
