# goal
how do we solve scarcity of resources

# solutions
- if we can find a base or set of base molecules? that we can then contruct things with, elements etc
  - then we just need machines that can break waste down to those base molecules and construct them back into useful resources
  - i believe we would never run out because of the law of conservation of mass
  - the cern collider would be a way of finding these base molecules
  - this assumes waste would always break down to the same base molecules which is yet to be determined
    - assuming the cern collider is successful it would pressumably hold true that it would depend on the amount of protons, neutrons, and electons, which i would assume is less than the amount thats taken in because the body uses some amount that i do not know
