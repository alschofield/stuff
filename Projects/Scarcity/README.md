# goal
how do we solve scarcity of resources

# solutions
- if we can find a base or set of base molecules? that we can then contruct things with, elements etc
  - then we just need machines that can break waste down to those base molecules and construct them back into useful resources
  - i believe we would never run out because of the law of conservation of mass
  - the cern collider would be a way of finding these base molecules
