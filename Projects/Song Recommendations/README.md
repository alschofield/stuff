# intent
i like songs, most importantly i want to get better at ML, not intended to be a high traffic production use site (unless needed i guess but i'll cross that bridge)

put in a little stuff im more familiar with (react), put in a little harder stuff (python), put in something i want to learn/get better at(ML)

i need/want to get better at ML because i want to be able do that well

currently unsure if the audio ml recommendation is even possible right now as a preface, which is fine because its mainly to just learn more and solidify my current knowledge

very good chance i dont finish this anytime soon due to the ML & python mainly as well as being accompanied by my work(prio #1) and studying math/engineering(intended to be long term projects for self improvement), i think i can get through the python in a decentish amount of time because ive written python/django code before, and the react shouldnt be too too much for this, trying to write more code and do more stuff related to that because im feeling a little down on my abilities in that area, most stuff (especially code) will probably come on weekends

and the ML is dual purpose as being more valuable and needed in the scanner for the DWC
