## when

### when did gender inequality start?
- pretty sure this has been a thing for a long long time that is inbedded in our animalistic brains

### when have we seen large changes in gender equality?
- 1788, Lucy Wright and Joseph Meacham, American Shakers Religion
- general trend towards gender equality post world war 2
- postmodernism from 1970's france, through its core ideas and by proxy because of psotmodern feminism
- most recently the UN

### have we ever seen gender equality?
- i want to say hardly ever, maybe you could argue that the Shakers got pretty close but id imagine thats up for debate as to how equal they were, its one thing to aim for it, its another thing to perfect it
- more positive note would be we are probably the closest to gender equality that we have ever been

## why

### why does gender inequality exist?
- gender stereotypes

### why have we seen changes in gender equality?
- generally speaking it feels like people have pushed and worked very hard for this, especially post world war 2 into postmodernism into the UN initiatives and thats why we have seen the most change

## how

### how can we get to gender equality?
- seems like the best solution is a group effort of holding each other accountable and being conciencious and aware of the people around us and how they might feel, as well as education on things we might be doing that perpetuate gender inequality
- outside of that it seems like itd start getting a little orwellian/huxlian (1984/brave new world)

### how do we allow gender inequality to exist?
- complacency
- stereotypes
- lack of empathy

## lastly
- i am far from an expert in this and these are some initial findings and thoughts ive accrued on the matter, im fully aware a lot more time could be spent here
- this isnt supposed to be a comprehensive document to understand all of gender inequality and more a jumping off point for more research or conversation to be had
- some of these things may be conjecture and id implore anyone to correct where they see fit
- <3
- truthfully, i just want the best for everyone, all love
