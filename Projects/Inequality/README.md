what types of inequality exist in the world

- racial
- wealth
- gender
- knowledge

to preface, this is an extremely complex topic with a lot of moving parts and polarizing ideas, my intention is not to rile people up or present my dribblings as the end all be all but to brain storm and contribute whatever ideas i can to the overall conversation going on in these different areas. now, ive been on a classical kick recently so enjoy some Erik Satie as you read
