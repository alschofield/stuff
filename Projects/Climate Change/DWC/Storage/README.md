# objective
going to need to store all the excess minerals and things that get outtaken from the filtration system, should store (link to shared/element_info.md)
- these things may or may not come as the raw element or as a chemical/combination (SO4, HCO3-, H2O)

# most optimal way to store each element
- need to be careful with storing gases in general due to pressure and the elements expanding when heated (thats why i would prefer storing as liquid where possible)
- see shared/element_info for ocean element info

# storage container device specs

# checklist
x = done, / = decent enough progress has been made
- [ ] how to break apart chemicals sent to storage containers
- [ ] how to build chemical breakdown device
- [ ] how to build storage container
