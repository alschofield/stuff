# objective
going to need to store all the excess minerals and things that get outtaken from the filtration system, should store:
    - hydrogen
    - oxygen
    - chloride
    - sodium
    - sulfur
    - magnesium
    - calcium
    - potassium
    - carbon
    - oxygen
    - nasa lists other as a component of sea water so not sure how we want to handle storage of whatever is in that

- these things may or may not come as the raw element or as a chemical/combination (SO4, HCO3-, H2O)
- maybe a system to break down any chemical to its most base elements and then store the elements

# most optimal way to store each element
- hydrogen
    - temperature
    - non reactive interior
    - proximity to other elements
- oxygen
    - temperature
    - non reactive interior
    - proximity to other elements
- carbon
    - temperature
    - non reactive interior
    - proximity to other elements
- chloride
    - temperature
    - non reactive interior
    - proximity to other elements
- sodium
    - temperature
    - non reactive interior
    - proximity to other elements
- sulfur
    - temperature
    - non reactive interior
    - proximity to other elements
- magnesium
    - temperature
    - non reactive interior
    - proximity to other elements
- calcium
    - temperature
    - non reactive interior
    - proximity to other elements
- potassium
    - temperature
    - non reactive interior
    - proximity to other elements
- other
    - temperature
    - non reactive interior
    - proximity to other elements
    - how to handle multiple varying "things" (whatever other is is probably a combination of a lot of low chance elements so going to need to handle multiple cases in one scenario)
