# objective
going to need to store all the excess minerals and things that get outtaken from the filtration system, should store:
    - hydrogen
    - oxygen
    - chloride
    - sodium
    - sulfur
    - magnesium
    - calcium
    - potassium
    - carbon
    - oxygen
    - nasa lists other as a component of sea water so not sure how we want to handle storage of whatever is in that

- these things may or may not come as the raw element or as a chemical/combination (SO4, HCO3-, H2O)
- maybe a system to break down any chemical to its most base elements and then store the elements

# most optimal way to store each element
- need to be careful with storing gases in general due to pressure and the elements expanding when heated (thats why i would prefer storing as liquid where possible)
- hydrogen
    - temperature
        - as gas
            - −252.87 °C and above
        - as liquid
            - below −252.87 °C (up to 1 kelvin i guess)
    - proximity to other elements
        - no oxygen
        - storing as liquid seems like a good solution, gas seems to react violently with air, oxygen, halogens and strong oxidants
- oxygen
    - temperature
        - as gas
            - −182.96°C and above
        - as liquid
            - below −182.96°C
    - proximity to other elements
        - pretty much keep away from most everything i think
    - warnings
        - DO NOT store oxygen systems in unventilated areas such as closets or cabinets
        - fairly safe on its own
- carbon
    - everything im seeing is about storing co2 and not carbon itself
    - temperature
        - very interestingly as a liquid
            - It can only exist at a pressure above 5.1 atm (5.2 bar; 75 psi), under 31.1 °C (temperature of critical point) and above -56.6 °C (temperature of triple point)
        - as a gas
            - pretty much all the time?
    - non reactive interior
        - carbon will grab on to everything
        - co2 i dont think will explode
        - co2 is toxic to humans
    - proximity to other elements
- chloride
    - temperature
        - as gas
            - -34.1°C and above
        - as liquid
            - below -34.1°C and above -101°C
    - proximity to other elements
        - KEEP AWAY FROM HYDROGEN
        - probably best to just keep as far away from everything as possible
- sodium
    - temperature
    - non reactive interior
    - proximity to other elements
- sulfur
    - temperature
    - non reactive interior
    - proximity to other elements
- magnesium
    - temperature
    - non reactive interior
    - proximity to other elements
- calcium
    - temperature
    - non reactive interior
    - proximity to other elements
- potassium
    - temperature
    - non reactive interior
    - proximity to other elements
- other
    - temperature
    - non reactive interior
    - proximity to other elements
    - how to handle multiple varying "things" (whatever other is is probably a combination of a lot of low chance elements so going to need to handle multiple cases in one scenario)
