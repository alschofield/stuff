# objective
going to need to store all the excess minerals and things that get outtaken from the filtration system, should store (link to shared/element_info.md)
- these things may or may not come as the raw element or as a chemical/combination (SO4, HCO3-, H2O)
- maybe a system to break down any chemical to its most base elements and then store the elements

# most optimal way to store each element
- need to be careful with storing gases in general due to pressure and the elements expanding when heated (thats why i would prefer storing as liquid where possible)
- see shared/element_info for ocean element info
