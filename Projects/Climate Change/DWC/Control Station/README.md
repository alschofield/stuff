# fun stuff
- a bar
- acrylic glass floors and dome
- all glass all around with metal curtains
- a telescope
- maybe a landing pad so elon has another place to land some rockets
- water slides gotta do water slides
- the best speaker system in the 7 seas, bangers only 24/7
- very nice lodging amenities, maybe we go underwater a little for this, make like a basement that goes under sea level, can still use acrylic glass for cool windows, and would allow for more space for other living space amenities, would be a pain to have to boat in and out of these if time needs to be spent there and its far out, need to make that as bearable as possible as far as making it enjoyable
- boats and ski-doos
- helicopters
- big enough to be able to have concerts with minimum a couple hundred attendance comfortably, so not like blowouts but like sizable gatherings
- rollercoaster
- mic drop

# control center
- amazing computer system
- keep track of current filtration cycles, and any and all scheduled
- keep track of and control pipe current/flow levels
- keep track of storage
- connect to other control stations
- ui's for all of the above for efficiency and coolness
- keep track of durability? of everything, like try best as we can via software to detect for any and all issues before they are issues
- keep track of surrounding marine environment? might be positives to this, would like to keep everything as it is unless absolutely necessary and this would allow ability to head that off
- keep track of any new or large amounts elements incoming through the filter
