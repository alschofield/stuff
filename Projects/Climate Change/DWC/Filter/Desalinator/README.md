# desalination
- solar distillation
  - heat water, water evaporates, water cools somewhere else
  - need to mimic the sun underwater, not ideal
- natural evaporation
- vacuum distillation
  - put water under pressure, it evaporates ate lower tempuratures, water cools elsewhere
  - seems more doable than the sun
- multi stage flash distillation
- multiple effect distillation
- vapor compression distillation
- reverse osmosis
  - this seems to be the preferred method atm
  - so water passes through membrane, mebrane catches elements, water goes through on the other side
- freeze thaw
- electrodialysis membrane
- membrane distillation
- forward osmosis
- wave powered desalination

# desalinator specs
- desalinate sea water
  - reverse osmosis
    - need to find a membrane that catches the different elements
      - might make sorting easier if we can catch different things with different membranes
    - worried about if things would still get through the membrane
      - if we can get it down to just the things we dont want we can do something like solar or vacuum distillation do get just h2o
- needs to output final clean water into the output component
- needs to output any elements/chemicals to the scanner component
