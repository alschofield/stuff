# intake specs
- steel doors
- steel interior probably
- need to intake mass amount of water
- thinking something like a whales mouth but like the opposite
  - we take in mass amount of water, we try to remove or prevent marine life from entering while taking small amounts from the larger pool we gather
- then maybe feed smaller amounts of water into the filtration component
  - allows easier control of the amount of water inputting into the filtration component
  - can use mesh to make sure marine life doesnt go in
