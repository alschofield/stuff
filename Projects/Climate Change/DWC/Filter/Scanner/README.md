# scanner
- input elements/chemicals
- may need to break down elements from desalination process
- some how place elements/chemicals in scanner (thinking the desalinator will determine some of this stuff, i believe different elements will be dispensed at different points and those can be inserted into the scanner from those points, so main focus should be on the scanner and computer tech)
  - conveyor belt
  - drop platform
  - slant platform
  - almost thinking like airport tsa scanners
- scanner outputs elements/chemicals into local storage
  - scanner checks and organizes chloride, sodium, sulfate, magnesium, calcium, potassium, bicarbonate, other

# break down chemical device specs
- need to figure out how elements will be output from desalination process and if they need to be broken down further

# computer system
- software needs
  - determine what the item is
    - potentially ML
  - dispense item into different buckets based on determined result
    - some sort of basic sorting bot maybe
      - needs to sort
        - chloride, sodium, sulfate, magnesium, calcium, potassium, bicarbonate, other
