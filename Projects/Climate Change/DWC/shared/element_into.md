# info
according to NASA in 2018, from 1 kg of seawater (100% = 1000g) (https://salinity.oceansciences.org/learn-more.htm) (would like a 2020 report)
  - 96.56% H2O (water)
  - 1.898% Cl - (chloride)
  - 1.0556% Na 2+ (sodium)
  - 0.2646% SO4 2- (sulfate)
  - 0.1272% Mg 2+ (magnesium)
  - 0.04% Ca 2+ (calcium)
  - 0.038% K + (potassium)
  - 0.014% HCO3 - (bicarbonate)
  - 0.0026% Other

# ocean elements
- hydrogen
  - temperature
    - gas
      - above ​−423.182 °F (-252.87 °C)
    - solid
      - ​−423.182 °F (-252.87 °C) - −434.49 °F (-259.14 °C)
    - liquid
      - below −434.49 °F (-259.14 °C)
  - proximity to other elements
    - no oxygen
    - storing as liquid seems like a good solution, gas seems to react violently with air, oxygen, halogens and strong oxidants
- oxygen
  - temperature
    - gas
      - above −297.4 °F (−183.0 °C)
    - solid
      - −297.4 °F (−183.0 °C) - −361.1 °F (−218.4 °C)
    - liquid
      - below −361.1 °F (−218.4 °C)
  - proximity to other elements
    - pretty much keep away from most everything i think
  - warnings
    - DO NOT store oxygen systems in unventilated areas such as closets or cabinets
    - fairly safe on its own
- carbon
  - everything im seeing is about storing co2 and not carbon itself
  - temperature
    - gas
      - below 8,721 °F (4,827 °C)
    - solid
      - 8,721 °F (4,827 °C) - 6,420 °F (3,550 °C)
    - liquid
      - above 6,420 °F (3,550 °C)
  - non reactive interior
    - carbon will grab on to everything
    - co2 i dont think will explode
    - co2 is toxic to humans
  - proximity to other elements
- chloride
  - temperature
    - gas
      - above -29.27°F (-34.04°C)
    - solid
      - -29.27°F (-34.04°C) - -150.7°F (-101.5°C)
    - liquid
      - below -150.7°F (-101.5°C)
  - proximity to other elements
    - KEEP AWAY FROM HYDROGEN
    - probably best to just keep as far away from everything as possible
- sodium
  - temperature
    - gas
      - below 208 °F (97.81°C)
    - solid
      - 208 °F (97.81°C) - 1,621 °F (882.9°C)
    - liquid

    - liquid
      - below 239.38 °F (115.21 °C)
  - proximity to other elements
    - sulfur dioxide seems bad so no oxygen probably
- magnesium

  - proximity to other elements
    - keep away from
      - sulfur
      - chlorine
      - fluorine
      - phosphorus
      - nitrogen
- other
  - temperature
  - non reactive interior
  - proximity to other elements
  - how to handle multiple varying "things" (whatever other is is probably a combination of a lot of low chance elements so going to need to handle multiple cases in one scenario)
