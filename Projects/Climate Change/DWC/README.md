# objective
- the ocean absorbs 30% of carbon from the air or something like that, my thinking is that is quite a nice net, if we take the carbon from the ocean, it continues to become saturated from the air and thus the air hypothetically would become cleaner as well, the water circulating back into the air would be cleaner hypothetically, more stable environment for marine animals

- current plan:
  - filtration device to filter out elements from the water to achieve an optimal ph
    - thinking about pros and cons of placement of these devices, close to land vs high ocean current locations
  - storage devices to house individual elements that are filtered out of the water
  - pipes that are suitable for transporting these elements underwater
  - control center to monitor and control all the ongoing processes

- want to use materials that do not further pollute the ocean
  - looking into underwater concrete and steel

- want a device surrounding the filtration system that keeps marine animals away from it
