# first thoughts:
- the ocean absorbs 30% of carbon from the air or something like that, my thinking is that is quite a nice net, if we take the carbon from the ocean, it continues to become saturated from the air and thus the air hypothetically would become cleaner as well, the water circulating back into the air would be cleaner hypothetically, more stable environment for marine animals

- almost want some sort of device that can filter carbon out of salt water based on the amount of carbon present in the surrounding water, if there is an excess, remove it, if not, leave the environment be

- would want to use materials that do not further pollute the ocean

- would want a device surrounding the filtration system that keeps marine animals away from it

- would want a fleet of filtration devices, a floating/underwater? control center/ closest land mass? (weather/environment is an issue for this), would want storage for the carbon, would want pipes leading from the filtration devices to the storage, manual and automatic controls

- ideally place these in an area with an high current so that power doesnt need to be allocated for pulling water to and/or through the filtration system

- probably missing some things

# questions that come to mind:
- most importantly, how  much carbon can we take out of the ocean and at what cost ratio, basically is this a feasable solution to the problem at hand, how much is the cost to create and how much to maintain

- second most important, how do we fund this?

- is storing large amounts of carbon safe? if not, how can we solve?

- what materials can be used to mitigate as much further pollution as possible? only makes sense if it produces a net good.

- is there already a device that can programmatically pull a specifified number or percentage of carbon out of a liquid specifically salt water? if not, how can we solve?

- what is the optimal way to store carbon?

- what is the optimal way to transport carbon?

- what is the optimal way to filter a specified amount of carbon from a liquid?

- where are the best places to put these to start?

- do we need to place these all over the ocean to be able to adequatly control carbon levels for the entire ocean? how does water circulation work in the ocean? are there hot spots that can cover large percentages of the water flow?

- is there specific type of piping that is needed to transport carbon?

- what sort of device could be used to keep marine animals away from these filters in a safe way?

- are there any other chemicals that we should look for?

- could the control center look for abnormalities moving forward so that future imbalances and things could be mitigated?

- any other oceanic monitoring that could be done?

- most importantly, has this already been done and/or is someone already doing this and how fast and at what monetary cost? if so, do i think i could contribute to speed things up or make things cheaper in any way shape or form?

- what else would make this not work?

- how expensive is all this?
