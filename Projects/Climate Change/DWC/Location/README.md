# questions
- do we need to place these all over the ocean to be able to adequatly control carbon levels for the entire ocean? how does water circulation work in the ocean? are there hot spots that can cover large percentages of the water flow?

- its going to need to either be in high oceanic current areas or closeish to land

# shallow vs deep currents
- shallow
  - closer to sea level
  - warm
  - depending on how these filters have to go in the water, may or may not be easier to deal with
    - if its a shallow current in deep water, that poses different problems than a shallow current in shallow (relative) water
- deep
  - further from sea level
  - cold
  - if support is needed for the filters that go to the bottom of the ocean, these might end up being easier to place, but i imagine most of these are pretty deep, really all depends on how deep "deep" is for the specific current, maybe there are deep currents that are relatively more shallow than other deep currents

# currents
- placement could be subject to proximity to land, how accessible the current is, and governmental restrictions of the location
- main idea is to use shallow currents that feed into deeper currents (which im pretty sure happens naturally eventually for most if not all currents)

- currently desired order
  1. Gulf stream, maybe in the bahamas
  2. Brazil current
  3. Agulhas current
  4. E. australian current
  5. Kuroshio/N pacific, japan or russia
  6. Norwegian current
  7. N. Equatorial current, around southern tip of india probably
  7. Alaskan current

- all
  - Gulf stream
  - N. atlantic
  - N. equatorial current
  - Equatorial counter current
  - S. equatorial current
  - Canary current
  - Labrador current
  - E. greenland current
  - Norwegian current
  - Brazil current
  - Benguala current
  - Alaskan current
  - N. pacific current
  - California current
  - Peru current
  - Agulhas current
  - Mozambique current
  - W. australian current
  - E. australian current
  - Kuroshia current
  - Oyashio current
  - Somali current
  - South pacific current
  - South indian current
  - South atlantic current
  - Antartic circumpolar
  - Antartic sub polar
- possible
  - gulf stream (seems like the most logical start)
    - shallow current
    - US
    - proximity to N atlantic stream
  - brazil current
    - shallow current
    - proximity to US
    - proximity to S. equatorial current
    - feeds into deep current
  - alaskan current (shallow part)
    - shallow current
    - US
    - closest to land that is also shallow in the north pacific ocean
    - feeds into deep current
  - N. or S. equatorial current
    - shallow current
    - seemingly major currents and specifically would want in the east side of the pacific ocean because they are the only shallow currents there as well as the indian ocean because i dont want to deal with somalia
  - Kuroshio/N pacific current
    - shallow current
    - proximity to japan
    - feeds into deep current
  - Agulhas current
    - shallow current
    - proximity to africa
    - feeds into deep current
  - E. australian current
    - shallow current
    - proximity to australia
    - feeds into deep current
  - Norwegian current
    - shallow current
    - feeds into deep current
    - proximity to land, england or norway or something

# close to land
- pros
  - easy to commute
- cons
  - could affect overall impact of filtration systems

# high current areas
- pros
  - allows for great coverage of the entire ocean
- cons
  - far away from land so can be hard to get to and most importantly to commute, leading to working at the CC difficult

# checklist
x = done, / = decent enough progress has been made
- [x] where to put these
- [x] where are major currents
