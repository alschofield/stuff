# questions
- do we need to place these all over the ocean to be able to adequatly control carbon levels for the entire ocean? how does water circulation work in the ocean? are there hot spots that can cover large percentages of the water flow?

- its going to need to either be in high oceanic current areas or closeish to land

# close to land
- pros
  - easy to commute
- cons
  - could affect overall impact of filtration systems

# high current areas
- pros
  - allows for great coverage of the entire ocean
- cons
  - far away from land so can be hard to get to and most importantly to commute, leading to working at the CC difficult
