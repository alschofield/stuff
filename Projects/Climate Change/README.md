we gotta do something, so if people wont STOP doing things, what actionable things CAN we do that presents more easily passable walls?

questions:
how much carbon (best estimate) is being produced at an given moment or time period (day, week, month, year, etc)
how much or that carbon is being put in different places? and how? is it all going into the air and then other places, is it getting directly into places some how? where all is it going? how specifically is it getting into different places?
how much of that carbon is safe to be in those places? how much is desired?
how much is already being taken out currently by any natural or human made means?
how much money, if any, has been allocated to this type of research by humans worldwide? (and a breakdown of where and how much for each)
