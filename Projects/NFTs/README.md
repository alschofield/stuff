# goal
- would like to learn more about blockchain and nft's by generating tokens via the ethereum network erc721
- if all goes well, we'd try to import into i think open seas so people can maybe buy it
- if you want to follow along more closely ill be heavily using this: https://ethereum.org/en/developers/ specifically we want to create a erc721 contract as stated above

- if this is something you are interested in and would like to just do, bypass the ethereum contract and go straight to openseas, they should have all the stuff necessary to just pass in files and create an nft that you can sell, as always this is a dual purpose project to get more familiar with blockchain and nfts
